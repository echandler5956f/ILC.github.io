                    <h2>Perception in Galileo.</h2>
                    <p>Galileo can utilize perception by incorporating information about the robot's surroundings in the
                        problem's constraints. Using plane segmentation, we can classify steppable regions from point
                        cloud data (recieved from a depth camera), and convert them into convex steppable regions which
                        can be applied as linear constraints in Galileo. This will enable Galileo to reason about the
                        environment in real time, avoiding obstacles and only stepping in regions which are flat enough
                        to be safe.</p>

                    <h2>Publications and Future Work</h2>
                    <p>ILC's work in control for legged robots has led to a paper submission to ICRA 2024. We plan to
                        submit two more conference papers in IROS + ICRA 2025 on Galileo. Our research goals currently
                        encompass the combined tasks of locomotion and manipulation, dubbed: "loco-manipulation".
                        Loco-manipulation for legged robots is one of <em>the hardest</em> problems in robotics. We
                        intend to use our
                        in-house switched system solver (Galileo) to build a multi-modal tree in real time which will
                        allow us to
                        solve both the optimal trajectory (a continuous problem) and the optimal contact sequence (a
                        discrete problem) simultaneously. This approach was inspired by the minds at ETH-Zurich in their
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09179.pdf"> Versatile Multi-Contact Planning and Control for
                            Legged Loco-Manipulation</a> publication.
